I have been a big fan of ninja and always wanted to be one in my secret life. Their mysterious lifestyle always makes me excited to know more about them. I developed this educational game to teach people all the major steps of becoming a ninja. As “gamification” which means the application of game playing to encourage engagement with a product or service becomes more and more popular, I think the text-based game will engage and entertain the audience who wants to become a ninja one day or in their secret lives.

This is the website that I use to create the steps for the game - https://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Ninja

I selected major steps and designed interactive questions to engage the audience such as step 1  Learning the Ninja Way, step 2 Knowing that Silence is Golden and step 3 Exercise and maintain a ninja body. I used condition, loop, list, dictionary and other techniques we learned from our class to do this final project. The game instruction is very straight forward, as long as you follow the steps listed in the game, everyone can become a ninja!

Educational games are not easy to design in a way to keep the audience interested and engaged the whole time. I tried to apply some practical questions in the games, such as asking about the player's weight and height in order to come up with the body index. Also, it can teach the player the skills needed to become a qualified ninja.

Hope you enjoy playing the game!
